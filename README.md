This repository contains supervised and unsupervised machine learning models designed for data science tasks. It includes Numeric Predictions, Classification tasks, and Regression tasks. The steps in the model building includes data wranggling and cleansing, data visualization, model design, model testing, feature extracttion, and model evaluation using matrix.

Explanation to individual projects:
1. Classification (Cancer & Iris): In this project, I looked at what the most important attribute/determinant is for classifying brain tumor and what the most important determinant is when classifying a flower. The datasets used are two popular datasets for machine learning (Cancer and Iris dataset).
2. Employee Satisfaction: In this activity, I test several models for predicting numeric outcome (employee satisfaction). I want to answer the question,"Is there a chance of them leaving the organization?"
3. Predictive model for DWM: The goal of this project was to design a predictive model to predict the performance of a Washing Machine created in our labs. I performed Data Wranggling steps, Attribute selection, data cleansing.
