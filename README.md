This repository contains supervised and unsupervised machine learning models designed for data science tasks. It includes Numeric Predictions, Classification tasks, and Regression tasks. The steps in the model building includes data wranggling and cleansing, data visualization, model design, model testing, feature extracttion, and model evaluation using matrix.

Explanation to individual projects:
1. Classification (Cancer & Iris): In this project, I looked at what the most important attribute/determinant is for classifying brain tumor and what the most important determinant is when classifying a flower. The datasets used are two popular datasets for machine learning (Cancer and Iris dataset).
